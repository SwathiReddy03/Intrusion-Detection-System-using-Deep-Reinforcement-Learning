# Intrusion Detection System using Deep Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on developing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using deep reinforcement learning techniques. The IDS is designed to detect and respond to cyber attacks within a network environment.

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset is preprocessed to ensure it is suitable for training the IDS model. This includes cleaning irrelevant features, handling NaN and INF values, and normalizing the data.

## Training the Model
The IDS model is trained using a custom environment created with OpenAI Gym. Actions, rewards, and termination conditions are defined within this environment to train the reinforcement learning model effectively.

## Usage
- Clone the repository and install dependencies.
- Preprocess the dataset to prepare it for training.
- Train the IDS model using the custom environment and preprocessed data.
- Evaluate the trained model's performance on test data.

## Results
The trained IDS model achieves high accuracy and F1 score metrics on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting cyber attacks.
